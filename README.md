# Pysicsformula

IN THIS PROJECT I ADDED FEW FROMULAS OF PYSICS TO CALCULATE ITS VALUE :-

THIS SAMLL PROJECT IS DESIGND IN SUCH WAY BELOW :

# FORMULAS
      FORCE = MASS * ACCLERATION
      WORK = FORCE * DISPLACEMENT
      POWER = WORK / TIME
      MOMENTUM = MASS * VELOCITY
      IMPULSE = FORCE * TIME
     
THIS PROJECT GIVE US ALL CONDITION OF THESE FORMULAS AS
     1:
      I -> force = mass * accleration
      II -> mass = force / accleration
      III -> acceleration = force / mass
     2:
      I -> work = force * displacement
      II -> force = work / displacement
      III -> displacement = work / force
     3:
      I -> power = work / time
      II -> work = power * time
      III -> time = work / power
     4:
      I -> momentum = mass * velocity
      II -> mass = momentum / velocity
      III -> velocity = momentum / mass
     5:
      I -> impulse = force * time 
      II -> force = impulse / time
      III -> time = impulse / force
      
      
YOU CAN CALCULTE ALL THE VALUES AS PER THE FORMULAS WRITTEN ABOVE
